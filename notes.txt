version 1.2 september -- changes made

added question numbers to the google quizzes (impossible to discuss them otherwise)
removed all BBC learners scoring
Added feedback (how to actually get the right answers) to all question responses
Adjusted some of the quiz language ('we did this during the live workshop') to work with general public
Corrected some errors (like feedback appearing for wrong quiz)

Beside the letter ‘E’ you will find a dropdown menu which lets you sort the sheet in terms of what is in the rainfall column. Choose ‘Sort Sheet Z to A’ and the rows will be organised from the biggest rainfall to the smallest. The top row will show 2 (February) in 2020 and a rainfall of 224.6mm.


** GOOGLE QUIZZES GIVING ANSWERS **

When you give:
right answer - you get a green tick, so you it's clear it's the right one
wrong answer - it prints the correct answer separately
no answer - it doesn't show the correct answers


** SIZING IMAGES IN MARKDOWN**
