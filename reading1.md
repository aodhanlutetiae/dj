**ANSWERS**

*p. 53 The figures also challenged commonly held assumptions about who knife crimp affects. The data showed in England and Wales in the 10 years to 2015, one third of the victims were Black. However, outside the capital, stabbing deaths among young people were not mostly among Black boys, as in the same period less than one in five victims outside London were Black.*

*p. 53 The data I needed was held by the Home Office in a data set called the Homicide Index. The figures were reported to the Home Office by police forces in England and Wales.*

- Manual data entry in a spreadsheet
- Extracting information from PDFs
- Getting documents from a person
- Getting documents through FOI requests
- Collecting data from an API
- Scraping data from webpages

*p. 51 This may be done manually through data entry into a spreadsheet, transforming information locked in PDFs into structured data you can analyze, procuring documents through a human source or the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), programming to scrape data from documents or web pages or automating data capture through an application programming interface (API)*

Typing in a spreadsheet & Sorting data
*Building your own data set encompasses a lot of the vital skills of data journalism—thinking structurally, planned storytelling and finding data in creative ways. It also has a relatively low barrier to entry, as it can be done with or without programming skills. If you can type into a spreadsheet and sort a table, you’re on your way to building the basic skills of data journalism.*

Social Media
Police reports
Newspapers
*p. 53 As there was no public or centrally collated data we decided to keep track of the information ourselves, through police reports, news clippings, Google Alerts, Facebook and Twitter*
