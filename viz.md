# WALKTHROUGH: Build a simple bar chart in datawrapper

Open the spreadsheet you used for plastic bags in England. Alternatively, import the data again from the [bags_2years.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vDqg-u6W4tHouC42uvhMOdy21oTl3ov/view?usp=sharing) to a new Google Sheet. Organise the sheet as shown in the [first Walkthrough](https://aodhanlutetiae.github.io/dj/sheets) then filter the years column to show only 2019-20 and sort the column 'Number of single use plastic bags' column ('from Z-A') so the data is organised with the biggest numbers at the top.

Now select the first eleven rows (including the column headers).

Copy the rows (either Edit/Copy in the menu) or CMD + C

Add a new sheet using the + in the bottom left.

Paste the copied rows into the new Sheet

Clean up the data:
Remove the year column since all entries are 2019-20
Simplify the column names (company, number of bags, proceeds (Â£))
Remove the decimal points from the proceeds column
Clean the names of the retailers where you think it's a good idea
Rename the tab at the bottom ('2019-20 top ten bag retailers')

Now in **File**, choose **Download** and **Comma-separated values** and save the sheet somewhere on your computer.
