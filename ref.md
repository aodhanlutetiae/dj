# Spreadsheet functions

All spreadsheet functions have three essential parts:

- =
- AVERAGE
- ()

These are the *=* to declare that this is a function, the *NAME* of the function which identifies it (and the calculations it carries out) so *AVERAGE* or *SUM* or *MEAN*, and the *argument* which is the information you feed into the function via the brackets to get your answer, so 'the numbers (or the cells containing the numbers) 3, 5, 12' for example.

> = SUM (5:5)                   sum everything in row 5
> = SUM (A1:A5, A7:A9)          sum several distinct selections
