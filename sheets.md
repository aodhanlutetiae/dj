# WALKTHROUGH: Get a CSV file into a Google Sheet

---
**IMPORTING YOUR FILE**

Download the following CSV file to your computer: [bags_2years.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vDqg-u6W4tHouC42uvhMOdy21oTl3ov/view?usp=sharing)

Once the file is on your computer, right-click on it and, under **Open With**, choose **Text Edit (Mac)** or **WHAT(Windows)** to look at what's actually in the file. All the values are separated by commas:

<br />

Close the file and navigate to your Google Drive online.

Open a new Sheet by clicking **+ New**, then **Google Sheets**, then **Blank Spreadsheet**

In the new Sheet, click on the **Untitled Spreadsheet** box on the top left and give your Sheet a name

Under **File** select **Import**, then **Upload**

Choose your **bags_2years.csv** file from your computer

If asked in a dialogue box about **Import Location**, select **Insert New Sheet** and for **Separator Type**, choose **Comma** or **Detect Automatically**

You should now have the CSV file in your Sheet:

**ORGANISING YOUR SHEET**

In the bottom left, there is a tab called **bags_2years**. Right click on the tab and select **Duplicate**. This will generate a copy of your Sheet with a tab entitled **Copy of bags_2years**. Double click on this tab and rename it as **data**.

<br />

Add a new empty Sheet by using the **+** button just to the left of the tabs. Give this sheet the name **Source** and somewhere in the sheet paste the following url, which is the where the data in your CSV file came from:

- https://data.gov.uk/dataset/682843a8-168c-4056-b6fe-741161a39f60/single-use-plastic-carrier-bags-charge-data-for-england

**THE DATA**

At this point we have imported the CSV file to a Sheet, we have named the Sheet and we have duplicated it so that we have a copy of the original data if we need it. We've also added the source for the data so that if we come back to work on this in six months we'll know where the data came from.

Our data has four columns:

- Year
- Company name
- Number of single use plastic bags issued
- Gross proceeds of charge (Â£)

It shows how many single-use plastic bags each major retailer issued in England in 2018-19 and 2019-20, and how much money they each collected from charging customers for them. The data was published in 2020 by DEFRA, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

**NAVIGATING THE SHEET**

<br />

<br />

Under the menu **View**, choose **Freeze** then **1 row**. This will keep the column names in place as you scroll down through the sheet.

You can adjust the width of the four columns.

Now, see if you can repeat all those steps with a different file: [the same data but for two earlier years, 2016 and 2017](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O-d4UbCn90mY4fvSWBNeUOkUgY3GXoFi/view?usp=sharing)
