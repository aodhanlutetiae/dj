# Finally

> Well done if you've worked your way through all this material (or even if you've skipped some parts for now). If you're looking for more ideas about data and journalism, here are some talks.
> And a book

<br />
- A [talk at the CIJ in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYzDnufwHNE) in which Aron Pilhofer explains what data journalism is (and isn't)

- A [talk from the journalism festival at Perugia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN2QXParCXo) on using data for local journalism

- A review of [interesting stories with data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbUIeMg5oVI) from the 2019 GIJN festival

- If you haven't already read it, [The Tiger That Isn't](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-tiger-that-isnt/)Â has served many journalists well since it came out in 2008. There are many similar books but it's still probably the best (and most readable) introduction to asking intelligent, sensible questions of numbers and it shouldn't cost you more than a tenner.
