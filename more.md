# Finally

> Well done if you've worked your way through all this material (or even if you've skipped some parts for now). If you're looking for more ideas about data and journalism here are some videos, and a book

— A [talk at the CIJ in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYzDnufwHNE) in which Aron Pilhofer explains what data journalism is (and isn't)

— A [talk from the journalism festival at Perugia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN2QXParCXo). The full collection of videos from the 2019 festival is available but this one focuses using data for local journalism

— A review of great [2019 stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbUIeMg5oVI) by Giannina Segnini and others, at the 2019 GIJN festival

— If you haven't already read it, [The tiger that isn't](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-tiger-that-isnt/)  has served many journalists (and others) well since it came out in 2008. There are many similar books but it's still probably the best (and most readable) introduction to asking intelligent questions of numbers and it shouldn't cost you more than a tenner.
