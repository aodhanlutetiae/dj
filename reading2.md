**Answers**

**1**
Computer-assisted reporting
> "In 1989, the U.S. journalism profession recognized the value of computer-assisted reporting when it gave a Pulitzer Prize to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for its stories on racial disparities in home loan practices. During the same year, Jaspin established at the Missouri School of Journalism what is now known as the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR)."

**2**
Detroit riots
> "In [1967], Philip Meyer at The Detroit Free Press used a mainframe to analyze a survey of Detroit residents for the purpose of understanding and explaining the serious riots that erupted in the city that summer. (Decades later The Guardian in the United Kingdom used some of the same approaches to look at racial riots there and cited Meyerâ€™s work.)"

**3**
Denmark
> "In Denmark, journalists Nils Mulvad and Flemming Svith, who had gone to a NICAR boot camp in Missouri in 1996, organized seminars with NICAR in 1997 and 1998 in Denmark. They also wrote a Danish handbook on computer-assisted reporting, created the Danish International Center for Analytical Reporting (DICAR) in 1998"

**4**
2009
> "By 2009, the increasing number of computer programmers and coders in journalism resulted in creation of Hacks/Hackers that would help more sharing between the two professions and ease some of the culture clash between the two groups."
