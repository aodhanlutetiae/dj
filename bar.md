# WALKTHROUGH: Simple bar chart in datawrapper

> There are many tools available for visualising data, all different in cost, complexity and what they can do. [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/), [Rawgraphs](https://app.rawgraphs.io/) and [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) are two online tools that offer a lot for free and let you publish or embed charts quickly. Below, we take some simple data and start to create a bar chart in Datawrapper. You can then explore the tool to see how best to finish the chart.

<br />
**PREPARE YOUR DATA**

It's a good idea to prepare your data first so that it doesn't require too much adjusting or editing while you're visualising it. Open the spreadsheet you used for single-use plastic bags in England.

Alternatively, import the data again from the [bags_2years.csv](csvs/bags_2years.csv)
file to a new spreadsheet and organise the sheet as shown in the [first Walkthrough](https://aodhanlutetiae.github.io/dj/excel). Filter the 'Year' column to show only 2019-20 and sort the column 'Number of single use plastic bags' column ('from Z-A') so the data is organised with the biggest numbers at the top.

Select all the data in the first eleven rows (including the column headers).

<br />
Copy the rows (either **Edit**/**Copy** in the menu or CMD / CTRL + C. Add a new sheet using the **+** in the bottom left.

Paste the copied rows into the new sheet. In this new sheet, clean up the data:
- Remove the 'Year' column (Select column A, then right click + 'Delete')
- Simplify the column names (for example: company, number of bags, proceeds (Â£))
- Hide the decimal points from the proceeds column
- Simplify the names of the retailers ('Poundland Limited' as 'Poundland' for example)

Now in **File**, choose **Save As** and under **File format** choose **CSV** and save the file somewhere on your computer.

(Excel will warn us that we're only saving the sheet we're looking at and not *all* the sheets in the spreadsheet)

<br />
**INGEST YOUR DATA**

Visit the [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/chart/spj9p/upload) site. Creating your own account will let you save and reuse your material, but it's not essential

Under the question **How do you want to upload your data?**, choose the second tab **XLS/CSV upload**

<br />

<br />
Check that the data has been imported correctly. Then hit **Proceed**

We now have a chart but it needs to be adjusted so it's clear to the reader what it contains. Use the four tabs **Chart type**, **Refine**, **Annotate** and **Layout** to refine your bar chart

- **Chart type**
The most effective type of chart in this case is the first, Bar Chart. But you can select other types of chart and see what works with the data you've imported.

- **Refine**
Adjust the appearance of the graph by choosing colours and the labels' appearance.

- **Annotate**
Add the text to explain what the chart is and what the source is, using titles and labels.

- **Layout**
Adjust what appears at the bottom of the chart. You can include a link for the user to download the chart data as a CSV file, or to download the chart as a .png image.

Once you're finished you can have it emailed to you (which involves setting up an account) or if you included **Download** and **Embed** options when adjusting the **Layout** you can use those to save the chart.

<br />

This chart adjusted the numbers to make it easier to compare for example 163 million to 62 million (rather than 163,280,210 to 62,107,841).
