<br />
> There are many tools available for visualising data, all different in cost, complexity and functionality. [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and [Flourish](https://flourish.studio/) are two online tools that offer a lot for free and let you publish or embed your visuals. Below, we take some simple data and start to create a bar chart in Datawrapper. You can then explore the tool to see how best to finish it.

<br />
**PREPARE YOUR DATA**

It's a good idea to prepare your data before visualising it so that it doesn't require adjusting or editing when you're visualising it. Open the spreadsheet you used for plastic bags in England. Alternatively, import the data again from the [bags_2years.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15vDqg-u6W4tHouC42uvhMOdy21oTl3ov/view?usp=sharing) file to a new spreadsheet.

Organise the sheet as shown in the [first Walkthrough](https://aodhanlutetiae.github.io/dj/sheets) then filter the years column to show only 2019-20 and sort the column 'Number of single use plastic bags' column ('from Z-A') so the data is organised with the biggest numbers at the top.

Now select the first eleven rows (including the column headers).

<br />
Copy the rows (either **Edit**/**Copy** in the menu or CMD + C. Add a new sheet using the **+** in the bottom left. Paste the copied rows into the new sheet.

Clean up the data:
- Remove the year column since all entries are the same (2019-20)
- Simplify the column names (for example: company, number of bags, proceeds (Â£))
- Hide the decimal points from the proceeds column
- Simplify the names of the retailers where you think it's a good idea

Now in **File**, choose **Download** and **Comma-separated values** and save the sheet somewhere on your computer.

<br />
Visit the [Datawrapper](https://app.datawrapper.de/chart/j6BRV/upload) site.

Under the question **How do you want to upload your data?**, choose the second tab **XLS/CSV upload**

<br />
Check that the data has been imported correctly. Then hit **Proceed**

You now have a basic chart but it needs to be adjusted so it's clear to the reader what it contains. Use the four tabs **Chart type**, **Refine**, **Annotate** and **Layout** to refine your bar chart

When you are happy with the chart, move to the last tab and publish it or save it locally.
